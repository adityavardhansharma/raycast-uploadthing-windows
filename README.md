# UploadThing for Raycast (Windows Version)

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Temporary Fork Notice**  
> This is an unofficial Windows-compatible fork of the [original UploadThing Raycast extension](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/tree/main/extensions/uploadthing). This fork exists only until UploadThing or Raycast officially supports Windows development environments.

## Overview

A Raycast extension that allows you to upload files to UploadThing with a single click. This fork has been modified to run properly on Windows development environments while maintaining full compatibility with the original extension's functionality.

## Features

- üì§ **Upload Files**: Select and upload multiple files to your UploadThing app
- üìã **Upload from Clipboard**: Upload files directly from your clipboard
- üìÅ **List Files**: Browse and manage files in your UploadThing app
- üîê **Secure Token Storage**: Encrypted storage of your UploadThing API token

## Changes Made for Windows Compatibility

### Crypto Polyfill Fix
**Problem**: The original extension's crypto polyfill was incompatible with Raycast's Windows environment, causing runtime errors.

**Solution**: Modified `src/lib/web-polyfill.ts` to safely check for existing crypto availability:
```typescript
// Before (causing errors on Windows)
globalThis.crypto = Crypto as any;

// After (Windows compatible)
if (!globalThis.crypto) {
  (globalThis as any).crypto = Crypto;
}
```
